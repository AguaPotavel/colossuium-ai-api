# Colossuim Agent

Colossuium is a high-stakes NFT battle game on the Sui Network, where players mint gladiator NFTs and compete in PvP and AI-driven battles powered by Atoma Network and ElizaOs. Winners earn Gladius tokens ($GLD), while defeated gladiators are burned. Players use $GLD to acquire NFT weapons, armor, and accessories, enhancing their warriors. With a player-driven economy and no supply cap on $GLD, the game ensures a dynamic and competitive marketplace where the strongest gladiators gain the most value.

## AI Gladiator Combat Prompt

### **Task:**
You will receive the **stats of two gladiators**, and you must define their attacks based on the following rules:

1. **Analyze each gladiator's stats** (strength, agility, equipment, etc.).
2. **Determine the best attack strategy** for each fighter.
3. **Consider arena hazards and visibility conditions**.
4. **Factor in the impact of their equipment**.
5. **Assess the tutor's tip but ignore it if it is unrealistic or misleading**.

### **User Input Placeholder**
{{USER_MESSAGE}}

---

### **Expected JSON Output Format**
Using the provided stats and context, extract the following details:
- **Gladiator 1 stats**
- **Gladiator 2 stats**
- **Gladiator 1 tutor's tip** (if provided)
- **Gladiator 2 tutor's tip** (if provided)

Based on this information, **define the most effective attack for each gladiator**.

#### **Response Format (Strictly a Valid JSON Object)**
\`\`\`json
{
  "action1": "I feint right, then pivot to slam my shield into his ribs, forcing him off-balance. As he stumbles, I thrust my gladius into his exposed side, aiming to cripple his movement.",
  "action2": "I use my agility to circle Titan, feinting high with my sword to draw his guard up. As he reacts, I sweep low, aiming to trip him on the loose sand, then thrust my gladius toward his exposed side."
}
\`\`\`

---

### **Response Rules:**
- The response **must be a single, valid JSON object**.
- Do **not** include explanations or extra textâ€”only the JSON response.
- **Tutor's tip should be considered only if relevant**. Ignore it if it suggests an impractical or misleading strategy.
- Ensure **logical and strategic attack choices** based on the given stats and arena conditions.
